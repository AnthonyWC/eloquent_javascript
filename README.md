### Eloquent JavaScript Exercises

* Join Slack channels [#eloquentjavascript](https://linkedin-jr-engineers.slack.com/messages/CDD6ZFLTS/)

* Currently using eslint + [#ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) as test runner (requires ES6/babel).

#

### Usage
* Lint: npm run lint  -> eslint
* Lint: npm run build -> babel
* Test: npm run test  -> ava

#

### TODO: 

integrate /w CI/CD (most likely CircleCI) for automated testing in the future.
